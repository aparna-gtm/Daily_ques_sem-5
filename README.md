# LeetCode Daily Questions

Welcome to my **LeetCode Daily Questions** repository! 🚀

This repository is dedicated to my daily problem-solving journey on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), where I solve at least one algorithm or data structure problem every day. The goal is to build consistency, strengthen problem-solving skills, and prepare for coding interviews.

## 📌 Purpose

- ✅ Build and maintain a daily coding habit  
- ✅ Improve proficiency in data structures and algorithms  
- ✅ Track progress over time  
- ✅ Create a well-organized solution archive  
- ✅ Share learning with others who are on the same path
- 
> Each file contains  **clean** solution to a daily LeetCode problem, typically solved in **Java**.

## 🛠️ Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees & Graphs
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Stack & Queue
- Sorting & Searching
- Sliding Window
- Binary Search
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- And many more...

## 📅 Updates

I commit solutions **daily** and each file is named to reflect the day and the problem it solves.
